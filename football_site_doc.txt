About project

This Django project is a football site that gathers data from the website fbref.com using web scraping techniques. The site provides users with information on the top 5 football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1) and the UEFA Champions League. The displayed data includes league tables, match results, fixtures, and team information.


Data is collected in the background using custom scraping scripts and also using celery to do scrapping periodically without any intervention.
The project stores scraped data in a local database using two main models: Teams and Matches

Teams model
Fields:
 - name
 - games
 - wins
 - draws
 - losses
 - goals_for
 - goals_against
 - goals_diff
 - points

Match model
 - home_team  ForeignKey (linked to Teams)
 - away_team  ForeignKey (linked to Teams)
 - date
 - home_score
 - away_score


Technologies Used:

 - Django 
 - BeautifulSoup & Requests: Python libraries used for scraping football data from fbref.com.
 - SQLite
 - HTML/CSS


Future improvments:

 - Implement user authentication so that users can customize their views (favorite teams, leagues).
 - Use Celery to automate data updates at scheduled intervals.
